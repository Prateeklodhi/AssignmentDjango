# Django Ticketing System

## Overview
This project is a Django-based ticketing system designed for managing and tracking user-submitted tickets. The system uses a MySQL database for data storage and includes features for user authentication, ticket management, activity tracking, and notifications.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: 
   - Login with email and password using Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system.

2. **Ticket Management**:
   - Users can create tickets with details like title, description, and priority.
   - Multiple users can be assigned to a single ticket.
   - Notifications are sent to users upon ticket assignment and ticket activity updates.

3. **Ticket Status Management**:
   - Supports ticket statuses like "Open," "In Progress," "Resolved," and "Closed."
   - Only ticket creators and assigned users can update the status and add comments.

4. **Admin Capabilities**:
   - Admins can view, assign, and update all tickets.
   - Track history and oversee progress on all tickets.

5. **User Capabilities**:
   - Users can view, comment on, and update statuses of tickets they've created or been assigned to.

6. **Notifications**:
   - Sends email notifications for ticket assignments and updates.

## Technical Requirements
- **Backend**: Django framework with MySQL as the database.
- **Frontend**: Basic UI for user login, ticket creation, ticket listing, and ticket detail views.

## Database Models

- **User**: Manages user data and authentication.
- **Ticket**: Stores ticket information (title, description, priority, status, etc.).
- **Assignment**: Links users to the tickets they are assigned.
- **Activity**: Tracks each update or action on a ticket.
- **Notification**: Logs notifications sent to users.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database Configuration**:
   - Update the MySQL database settings in `settings.py`:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
             'NAME': 'your_database_name',
             'USER': 'your_database_user',
             'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
             'HOST': 'localhost',
             'PORT': '3306',
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Apply Migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   - Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser.

7. **Admin Setup** (Optional):
   - Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:
     ```bash
     python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
   - Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` to log in as the admin.

## Deliverables
- Complete Django project files with documented code.
- SQL schema or migration files for MySQL setup.
- This README file for setup instructions.
